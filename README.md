# Description for Libre office Calc
'This Add-In includes a set of macros to "embed" Veusz in Calc  
'It uses TextBoxes as "Veusz diagram objects". The background of the  
'TextBox includes a png image and the description of the TextBox  
'includes the Veusz text. The macros modify the description and the image.  
'For example a macro saves the text as temporary *.vsz file,  
'opens this file with Veusz and exports it temporary png image.  
'The png image is than imported and but as updated background of the TextBox
