# Description

Addins to Embed [Veusz](https://github.com/veusz/veusz/) in LibreOffice Calc and Microsoft Excel   
These addins were originally developed by Stefan Eidelloth (software@isfh.de) in 2011. 

See the docs (TBA) for the explanation of how to install and use the addins.   

# Description of the addins
This Add-In includes a set of macros to "embed" Veusz in Calc  
It uses TextBoxes as "Veusz diagram objects". The background of the  
TextBox includes a png image and the description of the TextBox  
includes the Veusz text. The macros modify the description and the image.  
For example a macro saves the text as temporary *.vsz file,  
opens this file with Veusz and exports it temporary png image.  
The png image is than imported and but as updated background of the TextBox  
  
The software is being updated to reflect changes in Veusz, Excel and Calc since 2011.

A release will be issued in early 2025 along with some guidance.

Have Fun!
